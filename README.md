# framework-puzzle-solver
Simple C# utility to help solve framework puzzles.

I was doing framework puzzles, one day, and spotted one of the expert puzzles. Instead of attempting the puzzle, 
I decided to write a utility program to solve framework puzzles.

Feel free to improve the code, if you feel the desire.
